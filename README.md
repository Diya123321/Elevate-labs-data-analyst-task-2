#**Task 2: Data Visualising and Storytelling**<br><br>
New day ,new dataset .Today I have opted for an sales dataset telling the insights of Amazon sales from "kaggle.com".Before Data visualising and storytelling I have to clean and pre-process dataset<br>
For data cleaning I have used jupyter notebook and libraries of python like numpy and pandas.While data cleaning I have kept some things in mind which are as follows:<br>
Removing duplicates<br>
Dealing with missing values<br>
Clearing all the datatype related issues
<br>Removing all the extra symbols in ratings and discount prices like "$,%" etc.<br>
<br>
After cleaning the dataset I visualised it using Power Bi tools .Made many graphs likes scatter plots,KPI cards, Slicers,Stacked bar chats ,Clustered bar charts ,Tree maps etc in order to represent the dataset information to the fullest. <br>
Using this pictorial ways I have represented data and done a storytelling easily using power bi tools.It was a great task in order to give depth knowledge of Power Bi tools and Data visualisation which is the major part of Data analytics.
